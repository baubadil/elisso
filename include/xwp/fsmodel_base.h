    /**
     *  Returns the container's contents by copying them into the given list.
     *
     *  On the first call for a given container, this will perform blocking I/O and can
     *  take several seconds to complete, depending on the size of the directory contents
     *  and the medium. On subsequent calls, the container contents will have been cached,
     *  and the contents may be returned immediately.
     *
     *  Caching depends on the given getContents flag:
     *
     *   -- If getContents == Get::ALL, this will return all files and direct subdirectories
     *      of the container, and all these objects will be cached, and the "populated with all"
     *      flag is set on the container. When called for a second time on the same container,
     *      contents can then be returned without blocking I/O again regardless of the getContents
     *      flag, since all objects are already awake.
     *
     *   -- If getContents == Get::FOLDERS_ONLY, this only wakes up directories and symlinks
     *      to directories in the container, which might be slightly faster. (Probably not
     *      a lot for directories with symlinks since we still have to enumerate the entire
     *      directory contents and wake up all symlinks and follow them to test for whether
     *      they point to subdirectories.) This will only copy directories and symlinks to
     *      directories to the given list and then set the "populated with directories" flag
     *      on the container. If this mode is called on a container with the "populated with all"
     *      or "populated with directories" flag already set, this can return without blocking disk I/O.
     *
     *   -- If getContents == Get::FIRST_FOLDER_ONLY, this will only enumerate directory
     *      contents until the first directory or symlink to a directory is encountered.
     *      This has the potential to be a lot faster if a directory is found early. This
     *      can be useful for a directory tree view where an expander ("+" sign) needs to be
     *      shown for folders that have at least one subfolder, but a full populate with
     *      folders only needs to happen once the folder is actually expanded. Note that this
     *      will not return the first folder in a strictly alphabetical sense, but simply the
     *      first directory or symlink pointing to a directory that happens to be returned by
     *      the file backend. Unfortunately even this cannot be faster than Get::FOLDERS_ONLY
     *      if the container happens to contain only files but no subdirectories, since in
     *      that case, the code will have to enumerate the entire directory contents.
     *
     *  For all modes, you can optionally pass the address of an atomic bool with pfStopFlag,
     *  which is useful if you run this on a secondary thread and you want this function to be
     *  interruptible: if pfStopFlag is not nullptr, it is checked periodically, and the functions
     *  returns early once the stop flag is set.
     *
     *  To clear all "populated" flags and force a refresh from disk, call unsetPopulated()
     *  before calling this. For that case, you can pass in two FSVectors with pvFilesAdded
     *  and pvFilesRemoved so you can call notifiers after the refresh.
