     *   -- If getContents == Get::FIRST_FOLDER_ONLY, this will only enumerate directory
     *      contents until the first directory or symlink to a directory is encountered.
     *      This has the potential to be a lot faster. This can be useful for a directory
     *      tree view where an expander ("+" sign) needs to be shown for folders that
     *      have at least one subfolder, but a full populate with folders only needs to
     *      happen once the folder is actually expanded. Note that this will not return the
     *      first folder in a strictly alphabetical sense, but simply the first directory
     *      or symlink pointing to a directory that happens to be returned by the Gio
     *      backend. Unfortunately even this cannot be faster than Get::FOLDERS_ONLY if
     *      the container happens to contain only files but no subdirectories, since in
     *      that case, the code will have to enumerate the entire directory contents.
     *
     *  For all modes, you can optionally pass the address of an atomic bool with pfStopFlag,
     *  which is useful if you run this on a secondary thread and you want this function to be
     *  interruptible: if pfStopFlag is not nullptr, it is checked periodically, and the functions
     *  returns early once the stop flag is set.
     *
     *  To clear all "populated" flags and force a refresh from disk, call unsetPopulated()
     *  before calling this. For that case, you can pass in two FSVectors with pvFilesAdded
     *  and pvFilesRemoved so you can call notifiers after the refresh.
