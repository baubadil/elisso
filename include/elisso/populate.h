/**
 *  Populate thread implementation. This works as follows:
 *
 *   1) ElissoFolderView::setDirectory() calls Create(), which creates a shared_ptr
 *      to an instance and spawns the thread. The instance is also passed to the
 *      thread, which increases the refcount.
 *
 *   2) Create() takes a reference to a Glib::Dispatcher which gets fired when
 *      the populate thread ends. Create() also takes a reference to an FSList,
 *      which gets filled by the populate thread with the contents from
 *      FSContainer::getContents().
 *
 *   3) When the dispatcher then fires on the GUI thread, it should check
 *      getError() if an exception occured on the populate thread. If not,
 *      it can take the folder contents that was referenced by Create()
 *      and fill the folder view with it.
 *
 *   4) If, for any reason, the populate needs to be stopped early, the caller
 *      can call stop() which will set the stop flag passed to
 *      FSContainer::getContents() and block until the populate thread has ended.
