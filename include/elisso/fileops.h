/**
 *  FileOperation is a temporary object that is constructed from a FileSelection of file-system
 *  objects on which a file operation such as "trash" should be performed in a background
 *  thread.
 *
 *  The Create() factory method takes the FileSelection and the Type (e.g. Type::TRASH). It
 *  also adds the FileOperation to a given list which should reside in the caller's instance
 *  data so it can keep track whether file operations are going on.
 *
 *  Create() also spawns a background thread which actually modifies the given files. It
 *  creates a GUI dialog which displays progress, and all file-system monitors attached to
 *  containers are invoked correctly on the GUI thread.
 *
 *  This inherits from WorkerResult<PFSModelBase> so the worker thread can push file-system
 *  objects onto the member deque for file-system monitor processing on the GUI thread.
