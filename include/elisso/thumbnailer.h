/**
 *  Thumbnailer with three types of background threads that communicate with the GUI thread.
 *
 *  Create an instance of this and call connect() with a lambda that will receive
 *  finished thumbnails on the GUI thread.
 *
 *  Then call enqueue() from the GUI thread for every file that should be thumbnailed.
 *  From then on three types of threads will process the file's contents with as much
 *  concurrency as possible:
 *
 *   1) The "file reader" thread does a simple fopen() and reads the complete image file's
 *      contents into memory.
 *
 *   2) From there the file contents in memory get passed to one of the "pixbuf loader"
 *      threads. The C_LOADER_THREADS class constant determines how many of them should
 *      be started; the "file reader" thread posts the file contents into the "pixbuf loader"
 *      thread whose queue is the least busy. The "pixbuf loader" thread then uses
 *      GdkPixbufLoader with the format of the file to parse the in-memory conents and
 *      create a full-size GdkPixbuf from it. This is CPU-bound only, so we can run
 *      several of these in parallel.
 *
 *   3) Two additional threads then scale each such pixbuf to the "big" and "small" icon
 *      sizes. Whichever scaler finishes last (meaning that both sizes are finished),
 *      then calls the Glib dispatcher which signals to your GUI thread that the thumbnail
 *      is done. This will call the callback you gave to connect(). That callback should
 *      call fetchResult() to get the thumbnail.
 *
 *  The first attempt of this only parallelized 1) and 3).
 *  Some detailed statistics for a few sample files:

 *  So, most time is spent in the file reader (which reads from disk and parses the JPEG into a Pixbuf).
 *  Whether the file is on a local disk or in the network doesn't seem to make much of a difference.
 *
 *  This improved code has replaced the single GdkPixbuf::from_file() call by splitting the job into
 *  the thread classes 1) and 2), and it turns out that 2) can speed up things greatly by running
 *  it four times in parallel. I can get up to 95% CPU usage out of my 4-core (8 hyperthreads)
 *  system. It doees feel four times as fast.
