/**
 *  A worker result structure combines a Glib::Dispatcher with an STL double-ended queue
 *  to implement a "producer-consumer" model for a worker thread and the GTK main thread.
 *
 *  The worker thread is not part of this structure.
 *
 *  The P template argument is assumed to be a queable structure, best as a shared_ptr
 *  to something.
 *
 *  After creating an instance of this, you must manually call connect() with a callback
 *  that gets connected to the Glib dispatcher. This will then handle arrival of data.
 *
 *  The worker thread should create instances of P and call addResult(), which will add
 *  the P to the queue and fire the dispatcher, which will then call the callback given
 *  to connect() on the GUI thread.
 *
 *  The queue is properly protected by a mutex.
 *
 *  Something like this:


            WorkerResult<PMyStruct> w;
            workerResult.connect([&w]()
            {
                // Getting the result on the GUI thread.
                PMyStruct p = w.fetchResult();
                ...
            });

            new std::thread([&w]()
            {
                PMyStruct p = std::make_shared<MyStruct>(...);
                w.postResultToGUI(p);
            }
