/***************************************************************************

 **************************************************************************/

/**
 *  A worker result structure combines a Glib::Dispatcher with an STL double-ended queue
 *  to implement a "producer-consumer" model for a worker thread and the GTK main thread.
 *
 *  The worker thread is not part of this structure.
 *
 *  The P template argument is assumed to be a queable structure, best as a shared_ptr
 *  to something.
 *
 *  After creating an instance of this, you must manually call connect() with a callback
 *  that gets connected to the Glib dispatcher. This will then handle arrival of data.
 *
 *  The worker thread should create instances of P and call addResult(), which will add
 *  the P to the queue and fire the dispatcher, which will then call the callback given
 *  to connect() on the GUI thread.
 *
 *  The queue is properly protected by a mutex.
 *
 *  Something like this:


            WorkerResult<PMyStruct> w;
            workerResult.connect([&w]()
            {
                // Getting the result on the GUI thread.
                PMyStruct p = w.fetchResult();
                ...
            });

            new std::thread([&w]()
            {
                PMyStruct p = std::make_shared<MyStruct>(...);
                w.postResultToGUI(p);
            }
 */
template<class P>
class WorkerResult : public ProhibitCopy
{
public:
    sigc::connection connect(std::function<void ()> fn)
    {
        return dispatcher.connect(fn);
    }

    void postResultToGUI(P pResult)
    {
        // Do not hold the mutex while messing with the dispatcher -> that could deadlock.
        {
            Lock lock(mutex);
            deque.push_back(pResult);
        }
        dispatcher.emit();
    }

    P fetchResult()
    {
        Lock lock(mutex);
        P p;
        if (deque.size())
        {
            p = deque.at(0);
            deque.pop_front();
        }
        return p;
    }
