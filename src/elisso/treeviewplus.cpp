/**
 *  Override the mouse-button-pressed signal handler. This is to provide the following
 *  features:
 *
 *   -- We want to show popup menus.
 *
 *   -- We want to emulate the selection behavior of the custom Nautilus/Nemo folder views,
 *      which is a bit different from that of the GTK TreeView:
 *
 *       -- With Nautilus/Nemo, if the user right-clicks on a row and the row is selected, a
 *          popup menu opens with actions that apply to all selected rows. (If the user clicks on a row that is NOT
 *          selected however, everything is deselected and the selection switches to that row.
 *
 *       -- With Nautilus/Nemo, clicking on whitespace with MB1 deselects everything.
 *
 *       -- With Nautilus/Nemo, clicking on whitespace with MB3 also deselects everything; the
 *          popup window then applies to the folder being displayed.
