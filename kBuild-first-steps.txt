See http://trac.netlabs.org/kbuild/wiki/Documentation for the big picture.

To make kBuild build something for you, add something to the top-level target lists
(LIBRARIES, DLLS, PROGRAMS, OTHERS). For example, to build an executable, do
"PROGRAMS += myexe".

kBuild then takes the "myexe" identifier and uses it as a prefix for lots of other
variables, which you can override.

Most importantly, you need to set:

 -- prefix_TEMPLATE needs to be set to one of the kBuild templates.

    A template is a set of environment variables. For example, to build a simple executable,
    define "TEMPLATE_EXE = My description for an executable" in Config.kmk, and then follow
    up with sub-definitions.

    Most importantly, you must define a TEMPLATE_EXE_TOOL and set it to one of the predefined
    tools in /usr/share/kBuild.

    With the above, you want to set "myexe_TEMPLATE = EXE", and then it should work magically.

 -- kBuild also needs to know which sources belong to the prefix. So also set prefix_SOURCES
    to a list of source files (e.g. "myexe.cpp"), and then the rest should work magically.

Important environment variables:

 -- BUILD_TYPE=debug|release

 -- KBUILD_VERBOSE=1|2
